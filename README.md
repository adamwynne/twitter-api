# twitter-api

This is an up-to-date twitter API wrapper that is based on the clojure http.async.client library. It offers the full taxonomy of twitter API's (streaming, search and restful) and has been tested to be working. The test coverage is reasonably complete, but I suppose more could be added.

## Why did I make this library?
* I felt the current offerings were a bit out of date
* I wanted the efficiency of the async comms libraries
* I needed some stuff from the headers returned by twitter (i.e. the rate-limiting stuff and etag)
* I wanted full API coverage (restful, streaming and search)

## Giants upon whose shoulders I have stood

* [http.async.client](https://github.com/neotyk/http.async.client) by Hubert Iwaniuk
* [clj-oauth](https://github.com/mattrepl/clj-oauth) by Matt Revelle

##Leiningen

###NOTE: this library is fully tested under Clojure 1.4

Just add the following to your project.clj file in the _dependencies_ section:

```
[twitter-api "0.6.13"]
```

## Examples

### RESTful calls

```clojure
(ns mynamespace
  (:use
   [twitter.oauth]
   [twitter.callbacks]
   [twitter.callbacks.handlers]
   [twitter.api.restful])
  (:import
   (twitter.callbacks.protocols SyncSingleCallback)))

(def ^:dynamic *creds* (make-oauth-creds *app-consumer-key*
     			       		 *app-consumer-secret*
			       		 *user-access-token*
			       		 *user-access-token-secret*))

; simply retrieves the user, authenticating with the above credentials
; note that anything in the :params map gets the -'s converted to _'s
(show-user :oauth-creds *creds* :params {:screen-name "AdamJWynne"})

; supplying a custom header
(show-user :oauth-creds *creds* :params {:screen-name "AdamJWynne"} :headers {:x-blah-blah "value"})

; shows the users friends, without using authentication
(show-friends :params {:screen-name "AdamJWynne"})

; use a custom callback function that only returns the body of the response
(show-friends :callbacks (SyncSingleCallback. response-return-body 
	      		 		      response-throw-error
					      exception-rethrow)
	      :params {:screen-name "AdamJWynne"})

; upload a picture tweet with a text status attached, using the default sync-single callback
(update-with-media :oauth-creds *creds*
                   :body [(file-body-part "/pics/test.jpg")
                          (status-body-part "testing")])

```

### Streaming calls

```clojure
(ns mynamespace
  (:use
   [twitter.oauth]
   [twitter.callbacks]
   [twitter.callbacks.handlers]
   [twitter.api.streaming])
  (:require
   [clojure.data.json :as json]
   [http.async.client :as ac])
  (:import
   (twitter.callbacks.protocols AsyncStreamingCallback)))

(def ^:dynamic *creds* (make-oauth-creds *app-consumer-key*
			       		 *app-consumer-secret*
			       		 *user-access-token*
			       		 *user-access-token-secret*))

; retrieves the user stream, waits 1 minute and then cancels the async call
(def ^:dynamic *response* (user-stream :oauth-creds *creds*))
(Thread/sleep 60000)
((:cancel (meta *response*)))

; supply a callback that only prints the text of the status
(def ^:dynamic 
     *custom-streaming-callback* 
     (AsyncStreamingCallback. (comp println #(:text %) json/read-json #(str %2)) 
     		 	      (comp println response-return-everything)
			      exception-print))

(statuses-filter :params {:track "Borat"}
		 :oauth-creds *creds*
		 :callbacks *custom-streaming-callback*)

```

## Usage

Unlike other API's, the parameters for each call are not hard-coded into their Clojure wrappers. I just figured that you could look them up on the dev.twitter.com and supply them in the :params map.

###Some points about making the calls:

* You can authenticate or not, by including or omitting the _:oauth-creds_ keyword and value. The value should be a _twitter.oauth.OauthCredentials_ structure (usually the result of the _twitter.oauth/make-oauth-creds_ function)
* The callbacks decide how the call will be carried out - be it a single or streaming call, or an async or sync call. See the twitter.callbacks.protocols to see how it works
* You can declare new methods that use different callbacks by either supplying them to the def-twitter-method macro, or inline at run time (via the _:callbacks_ key/vaue), or both!

## Building

Simply use leiningen to build the library into a jar with:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/adamwynne/twitter-api.git

Resolving deltas: 100% (68/68), done.
$ cd twitter-api/
$ lein jar
```

## Testing

###NOTE:
You must populate the properties file *resources/test.config* before the tests will work. 

* To get the app consumer keys, simply use the https://dev.twitter.com/apps/<app-id> link and select your app
* To get the user keys, go to https://dev.twitter.com/apps/<app-id>/my_token

You can use leiningen to test the library using the following snippet

```
$ lein test
Testing twitter.test.api.restful
2719 [main] INFO com.ning.http.client.providers.netty.NettyAsyncHttpProvider - Number of application's worked threads is 4

Testing twitter.test.creds
Testing twitter.test.request
Testing twitter.test.upload
Testing twitter.test.utils
Ran 47 tests containing 117 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

Please note that the testing will take some time (about a minute or so) as its actually doing the calls to the twitter API's
